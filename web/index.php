			<h3>Why do we need pharmacy?</h3>
			<p>Today, the vast majority of websites selling prescription drugs online are doing so illegally — many of them selling unapproved, substandard, and counterfeit medicine. NABP has reviewed nearly 11,000 Internet drug outlets selling prescription medications and found 96% to be out of compliance with United States pharmacy laws and practice standards that protect the public health. Of these websites identified as Not Recommended, nearly half offer foreign or non-Food and Drug Administration-approved drugs, and many distribute dangerous counterfeits to unsuspecting consumers.

			<h3>What makes a ‘Good’ pharmacy?</h3>
			<p>During the prototype inspection phase the published inspection decision making framework has been used by inspectors as the primary means to support the indicative judgements they make about pharmacies. With the benefit of several months’ experience of the new inspection process we are now able to highlight some of the common features inspectors have found in good pharmacies.  .</p>

			<h3>“We are an online pharmacy and this is a great way to set us apart from rogue pharmacies.” </h3>
			<p>Just by seeing the .pharmacy domain, your audience will know that your website is legitimate and operating legally and meets standards set by a global coalition that includes International Pharmaceutical Federation (FIP) and NABP, which has supported the United States boards of pharmacy in their goal of protecting the public health since 1904.</p>
